	? Change "aspects" to the proxy objects
	
	- Frame buffer scissor test
	
	+ Depth mask and color mask must be set in frame buffer ClearXXXX methods. Should them be used as Program methods? No they are more related to the frame buffer Clear() method.
	
	? Program automatic restore to the default settings
	
	- Program internal frame buffer cache.
		
		With multiple framebuffers generated for various color, depth and stencil attachements. 		
		This eliminates external framebuffers manipulations.		
		Allows simplified "render to texture" semantics. 
		Use case: two convolution shader passes. 
		Possible problem is deletion of the created framebuffer objects
	
	- Program instances concept
		
	- Nehe examples texture deffered loading causes texture initialization error
	
	? Framebuffer texture available settings
	
	- Various webgl 2.0 features
	
	? uniformf and uniformfv methods overloading
	
	- BlurStroke shader
	
	- ANGLE_instanced_arrays
	
	- VERTEX_ATTRIB_ARRAY_DIVISOR_ANGLE. get vertex attribute parameter, consider it in automatic instance count computation
	
	- Difference between attribute index and location
	
	+ TextureUnitObject helper class. Default sampler uniforms sequential values assignment. https://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/TextureState.
	
	- Resources cleanup. Like disabling vertex arrays, unbinding textures from texture units etc
	
	- Embedded matrices builder module
	
	- UniformBufferObject helper implementation
	
	? ProgramSources proxy mode. 
	
	? `Uber shader program` (with list of uniforms like useLighting, useAlphaMap) in most cases are not good.
	
	? Multiple textures demo
	
	- GLTF loader
	
	- Array buffer `View` helper object instead of pointer. With _count property. 
	
	- _DrawPrimitives is coupled with VertexArrayObject

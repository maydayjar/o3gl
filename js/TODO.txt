	- Change "aspects" to the proxy objects ???
	
	- Frame buffer scissor test
	
	- Program automatic restore to the default settings
	
	- Program internal frame buffer cache.
		
		With multiple framebuffers generated for various color, depth and stencil attachements. 		
		This eliminates external framebuffers manipulations.		
		Allows simplified "render to texture" semantics. 
		Use case: two convolution shader passes. 
		Possible problem is deletion of the created framebuffer objects
	
	- Program instances concept
